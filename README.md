# Snake Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake Game written in C++, developed as part of the teaching materials for the Fundamentals of Programming course.

The use of straightforward and easy-to-understand syntax in this code is intentional, as it aligns with the educational goal of helping beginners grasp core programming concepts without being overwhelmed by complex language features. By focusing on clear logic and fundamental structures, this implementation serves as an excellent tool for students to learn and practice essential programming skills, such as loops, conditionals, and basic game mechanics.
